# rcu-builders

Utilities to convert Ractive component files into JavaScript modules. This is designed to be used by [component loaders](https://github.com/ractivejs/component-spec/blob/master/implementers.md) such as [gobble-ractive](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble-ractive) - unless you're creating a component loader, this probably isn't what you're looking for.

## Installation

```bash
npm i rcu-builders
```

## Usage

```js
var builders = require( 'rcu-builders' );
var rcu = require( 'rcu' ); // You can use your own rcu
var rcu = builders.rcu; // Or the exported one
var Ractive = require( 'ractive' );

// Initialise ractive component utils
rcu.init( Ractive );

module.exports = function createModule ( source ) {
	var definition = rcu.parse( source );

	// there are three builders - AMD, CommonJS, ES6
	var amdModule = builders.amd( definition );
	var cjsModule = builders.cjs( definition );
	var es6Module = builders.es6( definition, options );

	// ...
}
```

## Options

Currently only the ES6 builder supports any options. They are:

* `sourceMap` – whether or not to create a sourcemap
* `sourceMapFile` and `sourceMapSource` – populate the `file` and `sources` members of the sourcemap
* `preserveExtensions` – whether to preserve the file extensions for imported components
